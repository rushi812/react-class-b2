# Redux Toolkit

1. Create a redux store (createStore)
2. Connect the store with React app using "Provider" component
3. Create a slice (createSlice)

- name
- initialState
- reducers => action with reducer function

4. Export actions and reducer from slice
5. Add slice to the store reducer
6. Subscribe to the slice using useSelector hook

// github
